## Mappedin SDK for React Native Examples

To read more about the Mappedin SDK for React Native, refer to [Getting Started with Mappedin SDK for React Native](https://developer.mappedin.com/react-native-sdk/getting-started) and additional guides in the Mappedin developer docs.

The sample projects in this repo provide a client Id and client secret to access demo venues. Production apps will need their own unique client ID and client secret. Contact your Mappedin representative in order to obtain identifiers for your venues.

The following table list the sample applications that pertain to the latest version of the Mappedin SDK for React Native. PlaygroundSamples lists the activity name after the sample name.
